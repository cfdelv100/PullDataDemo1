This project demonstrates a understanding of AWS lamdba, ETL and S3 along with python in order to take spotify playlists and update them with creating a csv in AWS for its server with data. 
The project is based of the Spotify data pull by Liam Hartley that requests Spotify API data, loading onto S3 via lambda functions and deploying with terraform.
